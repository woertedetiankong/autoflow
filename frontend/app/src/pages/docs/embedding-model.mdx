# Embedding Model

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

The Embedding Model converts given input into numerical vectors (embeddings) that represent the semantic meaning of the input text.

In Autoflow, we use the Embedding Model to vectorize documents and store them in TiDB. This enables us to leverage TiDB's Vector Search capability to retrieve relevant documents for user queries.

## Configure Embedding Model

After logging in with an admin account, you can configure the Embedding Model in the admin panel.

1. Click on the `Models > Embedding Models` tab;
2. Click the `New Embedding Model` button, select your preferred embedding model provider, and configure the model parameters.

## Supported Providers

Currently Autoflow supports the following embedding model providers:

### OpenAI

OpenAI provides a variety of Embedding Models, we recommend using the OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` model due to its performance and compatibility with Autoflow.

**Supported Models**:

| Embedding Model          | Vector Dimensions | Max Tokens |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------- |
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536              | 8191       |


For more information, see the [OpenAI Embedding Models documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#embedding-models).

### OpenAI-Like

Autoflow also supports embedding model providers (such as [ZhipuAI](#zhipuai)) that conform to the OpenAI API specification.

You can also use models deployed on local AI model platforms (such as [vLLM](#vllm) and [Xinference](https://inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) that conform to the OpenAI API specification in Autoflow.

To use OpenAI-Like embedding model providers, you need to provide the **base URL** of the embedding API as the following JSON format in **Advanced Settings**:

```json
{
    "api_base": "{api_base_url}"
}
```

#### ZhipuAI

For example, the embedding API endpoint for ZhipuAI is:

`https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/embeddings`

You need to set up the base URL in the **Advanced Settings** as follows:

```json
{
    "api_base": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/"
}
```

**Supported Models**:

| Embedding Model | Vector Dimensions | Max Tokens |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| `embedding-3`   | 2048              | 8192       |

For more information, see the [ZhipuAI embedding models documentation](https://open.bigmodel.cn/dev/api/vector/embedding-3).

#### vLLM

When serving locally, the default embedding API endpoint for vLLM is:

`http://localhost:8000/v1/embeddings`

You need to set up the base URL in the **Advanced Settings** as follows:

```json
{
    "api_base": "http://localhost:8000/v1/"
}
```

For more information, see the [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/).
